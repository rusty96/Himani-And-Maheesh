                      <h5>Mehndi <span class="time">6PM - 8PM</span></h5>
                    <p>It's one of the oldest traditional Indian pre wedding ceremony where the bride and groom
                        attend the event together and a professional mehndi artist applies
                        mehndi to the bride's hands and feet. This will be having a celebratory
                        festival feel to it with people wearing vibrant clothes and dancing, singing, playing
                        games and a lot more.</p>

                    <p>This event is no way close to ethnic. The bride & groom would like to have some "shots before the
                        knot". With booze flowing down the floor and the western attire on, everyone would be busy
                        showing off their new moves on the stage which they have finely honed. Lastly, expect some beer
                        pong matches & karaoke for sure.</p>

                    <p>The haldi ceremony is usually held separately for the bride and the groom. This one is for the
                        bride. It is a low-key event that involves the application of turmeric paste on the hands, legs
                        and face of the bride. The groom is not allowed to see the bride after this ritual until the
                        final wedding ceremony starts.</p>

                    <p>This is the main event in the entire wedding when the bride and the groom tie the
                        knot. The groom comes with the barat and is greeted by the bride side with some dhol of course
                        as maximum number of guests would be attending this event. This is when the couple circle the
                        sacred fire and are finally declared husband and wife.</p>
